# Chessify
A 2-player board game of Chess that you can play with your friends.

# Features
- All standard chess rules are implemented including castling, en passant, Draw by Three-fold repetetion, Draw by Insufficient materials, etc.
- Added a theme toggle option to change themes. I would be adding more themes later on.

# About
I created this project just as a fun challenge (Atleast it was fun in the beginning). It has taught me many things as a programmer as this was my first (kind of good) project that I made in second year of college.  
If you want to try it, running it should be very simple. It is made with vanilla html, css and js, so simply cloning the project and running it should work.  
**Thank you for reading this and trying chessify.**
